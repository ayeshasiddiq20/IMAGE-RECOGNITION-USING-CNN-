# IMAGE-RECOGNITION-USING-CNN-ON CIFAR10 -DATA SET
In this project we will be using CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset includes thousands of pictures of 10 different kinds of objects like airplanes, automobiles, birds and so on.

Each image in the dataset includes a matching label so we know what kind of image it is.

The images in the CIFAR-10 dataset are only 32x32 pixels.
